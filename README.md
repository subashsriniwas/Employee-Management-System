## Summary:

  This project focuses on the development of an Employee Management System using Spring, Java, Spring Data
JPA, MySQL, and Thyme leaf. The system provides a user-friendly interface powered by Thymeleaf templates
and supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for efficient management of employee records.
The use of Spring Data JPA and MySQL ensures data persistence and retrieval, creating a robust and scalable
solution.

## Technologies Used:

Java
Spring Framework
Spring Data JPA
MySQL
Thyme leaf


## 1. System Architecture:
• The Employee Management System follows a layered architecture, consisting of:
• Presentation Layer: Powered by Thymeleaf templates for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
• Business Logic Layer: Implemented using Spring components and services.
• Data Access Layer: Leveraging Spring Data JPA for simplified data access and manipulation.
• Database Layer: Utilizing MySQL for storing and retrieving employee records.

## 2. CRUD Operations:
• The system supports the following CRUD operations for effective employee management:
• Create: Add new employee records to the database.
• Read: Retrieve and display employee details based on various parameters.
• Update: Modify existing employee records with updated information.
• Delete: Remove employee records from the system.

## 3. Thyme leaf Integration:
• Thyme leaf is integrated into the project to provide a dynamic and interactive user interface. It
allows for seamless integration of server-side variables into the HTML templates, resulting in a
more responsive and visually appealing user experience.

## 4. Spring Data JPA and MySQL:
• Spring Data JPA simplifies the implementation of data access logic, reducing boilerplate code and
enhancing productivity. MySQL serves as the backend database, ensuring data persistence and
reliability.
•Thyme leaf powered User-Interface, Here also MVC design architecture followed.
